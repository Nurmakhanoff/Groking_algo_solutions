Exercises of Chapter 1

1.1 Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of steps it would take?
128-->64-->32-->16-->8-->4-->2-->1  log(2)128 = 7

1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum number of steps now?
256-->128-->64-->32-->16-->8-->4-->2-->1 log(2)256 = 8
