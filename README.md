## Algorithm book problem solutions ##
This repository contains my solutions to problems from the book on algorithms that I solve for myself. In it you will find implementations of various algorithms and data structures.

## Repository Structure ##
- `July`: This folder contains the problems from the book, each problem is in a folder with the date I solved these problems.
- `08.07.23`: This folder contains my solutions to the problems for July 8, 23. Each solution is in a separate file named appropriately.
- `Ex-3.1`: This file contains my solution to the first problem in chapter three of the book. Each solution is in a separate file named appropriately.
