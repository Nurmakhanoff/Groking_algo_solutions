//8.1  You work for a furniture company, and you have to ship furniture all over the country. You need to pack your truck with boxes. All the boxes are of different sizes, and youâ€™re trying to maximize the space you use in each truck. How would you pick boxes to maximize space? Come up with a greedy strategy. Will that give you the optimal solution?
// Pick the biggest box, place it in the truck, if there is enough space, repeat. If not, put the second biggest box in there. Continue this.

    const length = arr.length;

      for (let j = i + 1; j < length; j++) {
        if (arr[j] > arr[maxIndex]) {
          maxIndex = j;
        }
      }
      if (maxIndex !== i) {
        const temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[maxIndex];
        arr[maxIndex] = temp;
      }
    }
    return arr;

        const currentBox = boxSizes[i];
        while (currentBox <= remainingSpace) {
            packedBoxes.push(currentBox);
            remainingSpace -= currentBox;
        }
