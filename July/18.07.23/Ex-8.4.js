// Answer is - not.
// Greedy algorithms make current optimal choices at each step. In contrast, BFS does not make choices based on optimizing any criteria. It explores the graph, visiting all the vertices at a given level before moving to the next one. BFS focuses on breadth rather than optimizing any specific goal or objective.
//BFS is not specifically for solving optimization problems, so it doesn't make sense (i.e., it's not even wrong) to say that BFS is a greedy algorithm unless you are applying it to an optimization problem.
