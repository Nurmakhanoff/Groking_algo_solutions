// Short answer is not. Quicksort is not a greedy algorithm.
// Greedy algorithms are not that good at final answer, but they are easy. It chooses the most greedyfull variant in the current step and goes along with it.
// Quicksort on the other hand "Divide and conquer" algorithm, that doesn't make the current step without thinking about future steps, but rather dividing the array and sorting the resulting sub-arrays. It does not have a specific decision-making process based on greediness in the current moment.
